Devlog – Day 2: Core Gameplay Foundations

Date: Monday

✅ Progress

ZoneManager: Implemented zone logic (Normal / Safe every 5th / Super every 30th).

WheelController: Random slice selection system done; returns SpinResult struct.

WheelSliceFactory: Temporary builder for zone-specific slice lists (adds bomb only in normal zones).

RewardBank: Working reward accumulation, reset, and collect functions.

GameManager: Core loop functional — spin → result → update rewards → advance zone.

🧪 Testing

Progressed through 10+ zones; safe zones correctly skip bombs.

Bomb resets rewards properly.

Console logs confirm correct flow and totals.

No runtime or reference errors.

🔜 Next (Day 3)

Replace hardcoded slices with ScriptableObjects (RewardData, WheelSliceData, ZoneConfig).

Refactor factory to data-driven system.

Expose all zone/slice configs via the Unity Editor.

Verify correctness with editor-based tests.
