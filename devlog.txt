Devlog – Day 2: Core Gameplay Foundations

Date: Monday

Progress

ZoneManager: Implemented zone logic (Normal / Safe every 5th / Super every 30th).

WheelController: Random slice selection system done; returns SpinResult struct.

WheelSliceFactory: Temporary builder for zone-specific slice lists (adds bomb only in normal zones).

RewardBank: Working reward accumulation, reset, and collect functions.

GameManager: Core loop functional — spin → result → update rewards → advance zone.

Testing

Progressed through 10+ zones; safe zones correctly skip bombs.

Bomb resets rewards properly.

Console logs confirm correct flow and totals.

No runtime or reference errors.

Next (Day 3)

Replace hardcoded slices with ScriptableObjects (RewardData, WheelSliceData, ZoneConfig).

Refactor factory to data-driven system.

Expose all zone/slice configs via the Unity Editor.

Verify correctness with editor-based tests.



Devlog – Day 3

Focus

Transitioned from placeholder logic to a fully data-driven wheel system, and built the tooling pipeline for scalable zone generation.

Progress

Finalized RewardData and ZoneConfig architecture (8-slice per zone, fully editable).

Removed redundant slice layer to simplify data flow and editor UX.

Implemented Zone Generator editor tool to batch-create level configs with automatic bomb placement for normal zones, safe/super intervals, and live progress feedback.

Refactored ZoneManager and GameManager to use generated data directly.

Reworked reward tracking via RewardManager for detailed per-type accumulation and clean session logs.

Next

Integrate custom amount generation logic in the editor tool (scaling by zone index/type).

Verify runtime logging consistency and reward tracking across multiple spins.
