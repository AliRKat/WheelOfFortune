Devlog – Day 2
    Progress
        - ZoneManager: Implemented zone logic (Normal / Safe every 5th / Super every 30th).
        - WheelController: Random slice selection system done; returns SpinResult struct.
        - WheelSliceFactory: Temporary builder for zone-specific slice lists (adds bomb only in normal zones).
        - RewardBank: Working reward accumulation, reset, and collect functions.
        - GameManager: Core loop functional — spin → result → update rewards → advance zone.
    Testing
        - Progressed through 10+ zones; safe zones correctly skip bombs.
        - Bomb resets rewards properly.
        - Console logs confirm correct flow and totals.
        - No runtime or reference errors.
    Next
        - Replace hardcoded slices with ScriptableObjects (RewardData, WheelSliceData, ZoneConfig).
        - Refactor factory to data-driven system.
        - Expose all zone/slice configs via the Unity Editor.
        - Verify correctness with editor-based tests.

Devlog – Day 3
    Focus
        - Transitioned from placeholder logic to a fully data-driven wheel system, and built the tooling pipeline for scalable zone generation.
    Progress
        - Finalized RewardData and ZoneConfig architecture (8-slice per zone, fully editable).
        - Removed redundant slice layer to simplify data flow and editor UX.
        - Implemented Zone Generator editor tool to batch-create level configs with automatic bomb placement for normal zones, safe/super intervals, and live progress feedback.
        - Refactored ZoneManager and GameManager to use generated data directly.
        - Reworked reward tracking via RewardManager for detailed per-type accumulation and clean session logs.
    Next
        - Integrate custom amount generation logic in the editor tool (scaling by zone index/type).
        - Verify runtime logging consistency and reward tracking across multiple spins.

Devlog – Day 4
    Focus
        - Zone progress UI implementation and system alignment with ZoneManager.
    Progress
        - Completed ZoneProgressUI with pre-instantiated entries and layout-group support.
        - Implemented GetZoneByIndex() in ZoneManager for UI data access.
        - Added logic to display empty pre-zones for centered alignment (e.g. o-o-o-o-o-[1]-2-3-4-5-6).
        - Verified stable updates when zones advance; indicator remains visually centered.
        - Cleaned up layout behavior and removed manual positioning math.
        - Identified edge case when reaching the last zone (index overflow) and marked for fix.
    Next
        - Add boundary handling for final zone (no ghost data past Zone 60).
        - Start implementing visual wheel spin logic (target-based rotation).
        - Prepare Bomb Popup UI prefab and integrate callbacks.
        - Plan UIManager event system to connect gameplay and UI elements.
        - Begin tomorrow’s full visual pass: wheel animation, zone indicator movement, and Vertigo naming/UI compliance.
